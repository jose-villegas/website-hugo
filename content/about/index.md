Hello there! My name is exactly as the site's name, Jose Villegas. I'm a computer science graduate with a minor in computer graphics that has been working for years as game developer. I'm originally from Venezuela, Caracas, currently I live in Santiago, Chile. Game development was a natural path for me coming from computer graphics after college as both share many similarities and I really loved games and developing them, I was already making games before I even graduated.

Games in some way provide us a way to build a different reality within a computer, you can't double jump in real life but you sure can in many games and I find the fact that we can build these worlds really amazing and exciting. I love making games, the whole development process involves having an extensive knowledge of programming in general. Learning, designing, implementing and testing all these features or systems or mechanics is quite the challenge and I think us game developers live for that. 

Another thing great about making games is that it's almost always a team effort. You get to know all these other amazing people that have skills in others areas such as music, art, design, management, user experience, interfaces, you end up learning a lot about other careers and sometimes they also learn from you.

I try to keep my curriculum updated on my Github. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/jose-villegas/cv-english/blob/master/main.pdf)
