I wasn't involved in this game during it's initial development, but the game required a couple of updates and bugfixes once in a while after it was "completed". I collaborated on estimating, bugfixing, consulting and maintenance for this game.

The game can be found on [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/banana-kong/id510040874) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fdgentertainment.bananakong&hl=en) the game has a lot of installs and really good reviews.
