For this game jam we went with a more spooky game. And we wanted to make it multi-player. So we came up with the idea to make a tag game but with some modifications to fit the theme and make it more fun.

# Overview

Little V and his friends went to camp. Later that night, his friends went looking for food. The hours went on and no one came back. He decided to look for his friends deep in the forest and he saw a big, spooky Mansion. He never expected the terrors living inside. 

Play with 4 people in a Tag-Like game mode, where as the Wolves, you have to catch the player using Little V to perform a ritual and take his body. As Little V, your objective is to remain human the longer you can. Be careful! The screen will get noisy when the wolves are close. The longer you stay human, the more points you will score! When the sun rises, the player with more points win.

We create this game using Unity, the game jam project; which has the source code and executables can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/haunt).
