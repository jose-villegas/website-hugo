This game is more competitive we were a bit inspired by the Tron franchise visual style. I was already in Chile when making this game so I worked remotely with my friends in Caracas, Venezuela to complete this game. This game was really fun to play.

# Overview

Emission is a quick competitive game, a capture the flag game where you need to grab and deliver the information to a goal point to win. We were aiming for a fun, flashy and competitive experience with simple controls and mechanics that could be learn in seconds. The looks of the game were inspired by Tron (1982 and 2010).

The game was made with Unity, the game jam project page; which has executables and source code can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/emission).
