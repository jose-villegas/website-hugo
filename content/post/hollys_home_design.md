On this game I was involved from the beginning, I got to experience our soft launch, and the game progression from scratch to a viable product. I was involved in developing and designing optimal architectures and data structures for the game, bug fixing, estimations, splitting tasks, graphical effects, optimizations, social features and game mechanics.

The game can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamaga.DecorateProperty&hl=en)
