I wanted to do a small tests with shaders in Unity to simulate water using sum of sines. This technique is well explained here in [GPU GEMS](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/all/modules/custom/gpugems/books/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html). My twist was just using flat shading. The reposity was well received in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jose-villegas/LowPolyWater).
