I moved to Chile to work with [Gamaga](http://www.gamaga.com/), I started with Operate Now: Hospital, a game published by [Spil Games](https://spilgames.com/) with more than 45M+ of installs. Operate Now is a hospital simulator, in the game you perform really realistic surgeries and follow a compelling storyline, while you also are in charge of running multiple hospitals, upgrading their departments, hiring and managing their staff and many other interesting mechanics.

# Overview

Operate Now: Hospital was the game I spent most time developing in Gamaga. I started with bug fixes and small features. Eventually I worked a lot with the client adding support for their back-end service, for this experience I was in charge of complex features or tasks from this point. I worked on the event system for the game, this was my first big feature for the game, then I did so many things for Operate Now that it would be hard to write about them all. Game map, grinding missions, skins and personalization features, cloud saving, new departments, special staff and so many more other features.

With the time I took a more leading role over this project, since I had the most experience with the source code at the time. This was a new experience for me, as now I was designing architectures for other programmers to follow, working directly with the client, estimating tasks for others, and being more involved in the management side of the project regarding programming.

The game can be found on [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/operate-now-hospital/id1136678102) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spilgames.OperateNow2&hl=en).
