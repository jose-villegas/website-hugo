Balloon Party is another game I started developing alone during quarantine for the COVID-19 crisis. In this game you throw a cannonball towards a collection of ballons and try to aim for 3 in a row, on success the cannonball gains another bounce as "shield", there are also multiple power ups that help along the way. This project was done with the intention of learning the ECS paradigm and Entitas.

I wanted to learn more on the framework [Entitas](http://github.com/sschmid/Entitas) for Unity, and used this small project to practice the aforementioned framework. I also put a big focus on the whole game elements being reactive to things happening during gameplay, such as explosions or new balloons, I wanted the gameplay to feel smooth but also flashy.
