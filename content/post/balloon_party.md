Balloon Party is another game I started developing alone during quarantine for the COVID-19 crisis. It's a match-3 game, focused on action, you throw a canon ball towards a collection of ballons and try to aim for 3 in a row, on match the cannon ball gains another bounce as "shield", there are also multiple power ups that help along the way.

I wanted to learn more on the framework Entitas for Unity, and used this small project to practice the aforementioned framework. I also put a big focus on the whole game elements being reactive to things happening during gameplay, such as explosions or new balloons, I wanted the gameplay to feel smooth but also flashy.
