After seven years after my last Global Game Jam I went back to it again, this time in completely different country, a different stage of life and completely new strangers, this was an adventure that was worth taking and a good reminder on how much I love working within a team and the thrill of getting the pipeline up to speed.

This time we went for a more cozy game with treasure hunt mechanics and exploration as focus. Most of my input as a programmer was on environment mechanics and rendering.
