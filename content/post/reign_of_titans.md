After my experience with Power Rangers: Morphin Legends, I got tasked to join a team on the development of Reign of Titans, a game for ABinBev with a focus on collectibles and card battling. The gameplay consisted of two live multiplayer opponents facing each other with their own titans and card decks. This project involved multiple technical challenges from rendering to matchmaking and live synchronization.

For this project I mostly collaborated on the implementation of rendering and shading, animation systems for the battle choreography, and the design of a system for different projectiles and VFX animations in conjunction with the battle actions.

The game involved live multiplayer, which added an extra layer of complexity. On the rendering topic, the "titans" themselves could contain multiple collectible parts; designing a system for rendering such a variety of assets was also required.
