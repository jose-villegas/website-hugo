This was my first Global Game Jam, though I had been to game jams before in college. This was a really great experience that ended up with me going for four years consecutively. The idea of making a complete game in just 48 hours was first daunting, but later awesome and completely achievable with good team work and focus.

# Overview

We created this game around a simple gameplay idea, it is about kids saving adults from the shock of the society because monsters like zombies, giant angry rabipelados and bunny cyclops ghost are haunting the city of CTM. 

This game was made with Unity. For the visuals we wanted a mix of 2D sprites and 3D environment, sort of imitating Paper Mario. You could play as two characters, as a kid you have to save adults that are frightened and cannot function anymore since the world is full of scary monsters now. We wanted to play with the idea that kids were more prepared than adults for an apocalypse.
