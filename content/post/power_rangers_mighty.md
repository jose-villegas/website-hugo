Tile's Waltz is a game I started developing alone during quarantine for the COVID-19 crisis. It's a match-3 puzzle game with focus on memorization, you remove pieces from the level, when that piece is removed other pieces move to take their place, you need to combine pieces of the same color to get combos or power ups.
