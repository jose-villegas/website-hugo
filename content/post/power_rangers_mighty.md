After working in Globant for a couple of small projects I finally got to lead a new game from beginning to launch. Power Rangers: Morphin Legends is an action role-playing game, with a complex turn based battle system, beautiful comic-like graphics, and many features that involve user progression. The game was published by NWay Inc.

I was requested to join as Lead Frontend Developer after this game was in protyping phase for at least two months. My main role was to design and lead the main system that would feature the core gameplay mechanics of the game. Specially the battle system, as this one involved complex interactions that would happen during battle, making an otherwise standard turn based game into a more complex and engaging experience.

The game needed to be fully reactive for most of the info displayed on screen, we created our own backend system for this, we built the game UI around Web API calls so the information was always up to date and accurately reflected the user progress and information.

As a lead programmer I had to plan features, design the software architecture for many game systems and mechanics, give support and feedback to my coworkers, work along other areas of development and also implement my own features. I was strongly involved into the game UI, graphics and optimizations, battle system, asset delivery systems, backend integration, continuous integration, and many others.

The game was sadly cancelled along technology budget cuts of 2023, this project got axed in that process. The game was meant for [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nway.prheroes&hl=es_CL&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1593144057?ct=Tap236604) 

Gameplay videos and screenshots can still be found around the web
