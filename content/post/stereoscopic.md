Stereoscopy is a technique that enables us to create the illusion of depth for binocular vision. You need special lenses to appreciate the effect. In this college project I implemented a basic rendering engine using C++ with stereoscopy.

The project code can be found on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/jose-villegas/StereoscopicRendererMeshSim). The render engine loads meshes and can create different primitives, as well define scenes with different cameras, lights and objects. There are other tecniques in the engine such as normal mapping.
