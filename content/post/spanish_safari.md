While I was still in college this was my first experience profesionally as a game developer. Living in Caracas at the time I got contacted by a startup called [LearnSafari](https://www.learnsafari.com/), this happened in my last year of college, thanks to the game jams. Spanish Safari is a game or a tool for parents, with the purpose of teaching Spanish to kids in an interactive adventure game.

# Overview

LearnSafari is a startup from Australia, that has multiple education games on the AppStore, the game I worked on was called Spanish Safari.

As a developer I was in charge of many things, developing mechanics, data structures, implenting different mini-games and small features, fixing bugs, etc. Since we were a small team I also had input on game mechanics design, level design, animations, and many other things, not just programming.

It was a really good experience where I learned a lot about team work in a professional environment, project management, communication, tasks estimations, coding standards, and many more things.

Though the game isn't a popular success, albeit justified; the target is really specific, it has good ratings in the Apple Store.
