This was an extremely simple raytracer I wrote in college for an assignment. Here I could learn a lot about the mathematics and physics that makeup light rendering.

The raytracer is implemented in C++, it receives primitives through a YAML file, where different primitives and their transforms can be defined.  The source code can be found [here on my GitHub](https://github.com/jose-villegas/Simple-Raytracer).
