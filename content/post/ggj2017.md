This time we really wanted to do a co-op game. We built the idea around a platform game where you play with your friend, you both co-perate together to advance in the map and defeat enemies.

# Overview

Echo Switch is co-op 2 player game. It requires 1 keyboard and 1 controller. Use your echo ability to reveal hidden platforms and get to the end! 

The planet Echo uses waves to sustain its life, because of this the people of this planet got the ability to control different kinds of waves. 

One day creatures from another dimension decided to invade the reality of the Echo's citizens, hungry for the wave power they enslaved almost everyone. 

That's why our heroes Patty and Heliwood are fighting to free their planet, Echo.

The game was built using Unity and the game jam project; which has the source code and executables, can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/echo-switch).
